# Login Validation Form  

A simple responsive **Login/Signup validation form** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project validates user input, checks for password confirmation, and displays a welcome message.

## ⚡ How it Works
1. User fills **Email/Phone** and both **Password fields**.  
2. JavaScript checks:  
   - If any field is empty → shows `"All fields are required."`  
   - If passwords don’t match → shows `"Passwords don't match, re-check and try again."`  
   - If all valid → greets user with `"Login successful, welcome back <username>!"`  
3. Form resets after submission (success or error).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)** – validation logic
